title: He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or NOT?
summary: It is well known that J.K. Rowling made a wonderful job in the Harry Potter
  series creating a lot of great characters. From Albus Dumbledore to Severus Snape,
  these “good” guys made themselves heroes in their specific but persuading ways.
  However, Lord Voldemort, standing on the other side of the book, however “bad” we
  know, was just described simply by the very word “bad”. Abandoned by his own family,
  having no friends at all, and killing himself twice, Lord Voldemort, must be the
  poorest bad guy ever. Considering the data collected from the book, did J.K. Rowling
  create successfully a “bad” guy that could match the greatness of the justice side?
