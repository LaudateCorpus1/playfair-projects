* This is a project about the relationship between mass shooting casualties and population, and the comparison between state gun regulation. Using the same dataset as the former one, I further explore whether gun control is related to the public safety or not.
* I cleaned up the data with Ipython Notebook, make a defult style scatter chart with matplotlib and export it to AI to make further polishments.
* You can find the notebook, data, and the draft pdf.
