# US Dependency on Unskilled Foreign Laborers

#Summary
- A lot of US election campaign has been about migration this year. Mostly
focussing on all the illegal immigrants entering the US.
- Since 2009 US companies have, however, hired 1,4 million unskilled, foreign
laborers to work on farms, in care taking jobs, etc.
- The companies can hire foreign workers in the H2A and H2B visa programmes.
- [Here's a guideline](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2a-temporary-agricultural-workers) how companies have to proceed:

##Â Tools
- Pulling all the files in and working through the relevant columns using Pandas
- Clustering Company names using [Word2Vec](https://github.com/danielfrg/word2vec/blob/master/examples/word2vec.ipynb)
- I will also do some reporting
- A map of the USA with workers by state might also be interesting. Maybe even by
type of worker.

## Sources
- Data generated by the the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). [The data is here](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm) more
recently the data is faulty. In touch with their press office for them
to fix the data (<Reich.Egan@dol.gov>, <Roberts.David@dol.gov>) The H2A and the
H2B data seems to be correct now.

**Am am also thinking of making a map of the us with states colored by number
of unskilled workers. Maybe even work out the type of unskilled work. In the
south I am expecting more farming jobs. They will be in the majority. There might,
however, be jobs in some states that aren't in farming.**
