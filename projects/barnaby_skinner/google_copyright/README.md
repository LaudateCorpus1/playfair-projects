# What's up with all those Dead Links?

#### SUMMARY
Copyright issues are a major concern on the Internet. Every single day, Google receives thousands and thousands of request from copyright owners to remove links to content they consider to be theirs. For many this is the most effective way to deal with the problem. Much more effective than trying to delete the images of servers. As sometimes the content is distributed over many servers. Google takes these requests and checks whether the claims are correct and how many are false. I'm not sure how the search engine does this, I'm not sure. As the bulk of removal requests is so big, I am guessing the process must be automated.
