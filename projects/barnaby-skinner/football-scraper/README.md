# Automated gathering, analysis and visualization of Bundesliga Football Data

#Summary v.2.0
- Develop a scraper to show how German Bundesliga tranfers in season 16/17
compare
- This is an extension of my initial [scraper for the Swiss League[(https://github.com/barjacks/fussball)].
That's why I'm calling it v.2.0 :-)

##Â Tools
- Using BeautifulSoup for the scraping, Pandas for the graphs and a few little
last tweaks with Adobe Illustrator.

## Source
- The multilingual Football stat site transfermarkt.com. Using the German Domain,
transfermarkt.de to scrape. This is important because text elements in the code
are in German, on the .com site in English.
