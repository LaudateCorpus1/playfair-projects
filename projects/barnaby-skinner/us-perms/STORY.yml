title: Green Lights for Green Cards
summary: 85% of Green Card applications to the US are accepted. This high rate is
  due to the fact that getting as far as the official application requires a lot of
  paper work and legal hurdles in itself. And most importantly, it requires you have
  a company offering you a job, who is able to prove they could not find any suitable
  employee in the US. However, not all nations are equally welcome.
