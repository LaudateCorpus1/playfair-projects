heart diseases : leading causes of death in NYC

Exploratory questions for the data:

In what year newyorkers died the most?
who is more likely to die according to gender?
what is the top 15 diseases in this city?
what is the total death per each disease?
Does ethnicity has something to do with it?

Problems I found:

1) The data set available it only has information until 2011, which is pretty old. But it is all
NYC official records got.
2) There were less cases reported for hispanic and asians, but I don't know if it fits to the
 demographic reality of the NY state or if its just what happens to be reported.

Design decision:

For designing a graph that would tell a meaningful history, I think less is always better. Therefore,
I tried to achieve effective simplicity with 4 bar graphs of the top 5 leading diseases in NYC that
will show how much cardiovascular problems affect new yorkers.
