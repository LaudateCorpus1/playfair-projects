title: 'Hitler''s Magic Words: Before and After Hitler became the Führer'
summary: Hitler was known for his ability to control people's emotions with his oratory.
  I tried to look at most frequently used words and changes in his selection of words
  as he becomes the führer of the Nazi Germany. Two most frequently used words for
  both era are 'People' and 'Germany'. Before he became the führer, he used the word
  'Jew' quite a bit, but interestingly, he barely talked about 'Jew' after he takes
  over complete power. Instead, the use of the word 'War' increased dramatically.
