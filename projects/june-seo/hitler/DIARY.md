Result threw bunch of random words and their counts.
It was really hard for me to analyze and find meaningful things just by looking at those nouns and their frequency.
So I read through some of Hitler's speeches even though that defeats the purpose of doing text analysis.
I realized that just by doing word analysis, it can be very hard to capture the power and nuance that the text/speech originally had.

Moreover, a word can be consists of two words and it can be painful to analyze.
For example, World War becomes world and war, Versailles Treaty becomes versailles and treaty.
I tried to use textblob noun phrases and it seems like it is not working well.

And it was hard to tell if Hitler was positive or negative toward certain noun without looking at contexts.
