# Instagram API
I chose Instagram API to see popular avocado toast venues in NYC. Instagram users tend to take pictures of their avocado toasts and upload them with hashtags #avocadotoast, #avosmash or #avocadosmash and check-in to the location. I assumed I could gather those venues by using hashtags. But apparently, when I search, I can't relate hashtags to locations. It would just give me number of postings with such hashtags with certain boundary of geography.

# Twitter API
I move on to Twitter API since it provides coordinate information of tweets with specific hashtags. I set point to the center of the central park and set 40km radius to cover most of the New York City. Because of the recent update, twitter API gives asked information within only 5 miles radius. Moreover, GEO does not work appropriately according to people who attempted to do same thing as me.
It only throws most recent 13 tweets.... and I gave up on Twitter.
