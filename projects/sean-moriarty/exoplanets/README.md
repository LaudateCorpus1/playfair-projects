So, this is all the stuff I wound up with after trying to make something of the exoplanets project for entirely too long. There is an explaination for everything in the diary, but the code I wrote to make the static images is in the exoplanets.ipynb. My raw data in is the phl_hec_all_confirmed.csv, which I messed with a little bit to make the pared csv file. The .pdfs are a product of that thing, and I basically stopped once I couldn't make something work that both got everything on the page and represented them meaningfully.

The d3 attempt is in the exoplanets-json-maker.ipynb. Since all that does is take the csv and turn it into json that the zoomable circles example can use, the notebook itself is not that interesting. In the d3_examples folder is my actual visualization, in the zoomable circles folder. The bubble chart was there to help me figure out how to do things in zoomable circles, fat lot of good it did me.
