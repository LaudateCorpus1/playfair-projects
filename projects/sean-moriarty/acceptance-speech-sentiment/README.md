The story here is basically that, while a campaign acceptance speech is going to be very positive, some are more positive than others. We all feel like Trump is so down on everything, what if we compared the language in his first big speech as a candidate vs Hillary Clinton, who most people also have very strong feelings about? I expected Trump's line to be below zero, but between all the thank you's and congrats and so forth, there isn't really much time to be negative. Trump used every inch he had for negativity, however, and he in the end he turned in a historically negative speech. Clinton, meanwhile, was very positive, and since she managed to talk longer than anyone, accrued more positivity points than anyone else.

I calculated all this by feeding Mike Williams' language sentiment analyzer these speeches, one sentence at a time. A sentence like "Thank you everyone" or "I sure love my family" or "God bless America" (most of the content of these speeches) was initially worth a 1, while a sentence like "Things sure are crappy" or "The other guys sure are the worst" (a decent amount of the rest) was a -1. I then adjusted for sentence length in words and average word length, as in my opinion, a sentence like "America is great because we have all the food, we have all the motorcycles, we are the raddest around, and everyone loves us, and rainbows sparkle in our mind's eyes" is more positive than "America good."
