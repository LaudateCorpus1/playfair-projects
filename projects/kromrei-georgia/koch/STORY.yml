title: Koch University
summary: |-
  The Koch brothers have given more than 45 million dollars to George Mason University and its associated foundations over the past 9 years. Presumably, according to tax returns, this money is used for scholarships and for furthering the goals and aims of George Mason University.
  The closest metropolitan area to to George Mason University is Washington D.C.. The amount paid to the highest-paid employee is consistently much higher than the total yearly disbursement for scholarships to individuals. I wanted to show the dramatic difference in the Koch brothers' donations to other institutions and to GMU, and also examine the institutions to which the money was being donated. The largest expenses for each of the institutes at GMU are their donations to the other institutes at GMU, and the only grants given that was not another institution at GMU or an individual grant was to Florida State University and to the Virginia Lyric Opera.
