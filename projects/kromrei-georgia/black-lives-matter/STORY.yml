title: Black Preschoolers are Punished Disproportionately
summary: Racial bias is recognized in our criminal justice system and in our school
  system, but it is shocking to see how evident it is in preschool. Black preschoolers
  are given suspensions and expulsions more than their white classmates. Female black
  preschoolers are even _more_ likely to receive disciplinary actions. Schools that
  punish their children more tend to have higher black enrollment.
