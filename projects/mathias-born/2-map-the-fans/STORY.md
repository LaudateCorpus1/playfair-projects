I recently received the ZIP-codes for every long term card for the games of Bern's biggest sport clubs "YB" (football) and "SCB" (ice hockey). Let's make a map out of it. 

The main visualization is [fanmap.html](fanmap.html). There's a second one (with some issues) called [fanmap2.html](fanmap2.html). The maps are also available at Carto: [Map for soccer (YB)](https://bz.carto.com/viz/7cb989ec-58e5-11e6-8f74-0e05a8b3e3d7/public_map), [map for ice hockey (SCB)](https://bz.carto.com/viz/d7a3b630-5867-11e6-b0ab-0e3ebc282e83/public_map). 

There are some exports here:
