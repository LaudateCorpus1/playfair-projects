# Where are the fans living?

Is it true that football is an urban thing while ice hockey is the country bumpkin's game? 

I recently received the ZIP-codes for every long term card for the games of Bern's biggest sport clubs "YB" (football) and "SCB" (ice hockey). With this data I am generating a map showing whe ZIP code areas where the fans are living.
