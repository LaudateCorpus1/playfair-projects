DATA SOURCE
For this project I downloaded from the NYC Open data corresponding CSV file
with all the information registered since 2008. Here is the link:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/New-York-City-Leading-Causes-of-Death/jb7j-dtam

WHAT I WANTED FROM THE DATA:
I wanted to use it to create a simple but effective history on the #1 NYC public
health issues, which happens to be heart diseases.

HOW I WORKED WITH THE DATA AND WHAT PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED
What I did was an exploratory analysis using descriptive stats and basic plotting.
The main problem I found was that the information is limited only to four years
and has not been updated since 2011.
