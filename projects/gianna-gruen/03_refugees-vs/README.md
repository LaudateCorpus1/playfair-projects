Manually collected data from various sources (see Diary) for
- overall government spending on {refugees, pensioners, social benefit recipients}
- number of {refugees, pensioners, social benefit recipients}
- calculated the per capita spendings

Abandoned whole project because there wasn't enough consistent data for more follow-up graphics to turn this into a nice rounded-up story.
