## Growth of NASA Lab Facilities Within US ##

I picked up the NASA Laboratory facilities data set from Data.gov: http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/agency-data-on-user-facilities. This time, in addition to reworking on the graphs that I had created earlier, more graphs have been added to visually represent the distribution and growth trend of NASA Laboratory facilities in the USA.

### An Insight Into NASA Laboratory Facilities ###

* NASA runs a total of 397 lab facilities, Nasa Intelsat runs 17, Department of Defence(DOD) runs 7 labs, Department of Energy runs 12 labs, Raytheon runs 5, and Orbital Sciences Corporation (osc) runs only one NASA lab facility.
* The highest number of labs are located in the state : Alabama
* The lowest number of labs are located in the state : Arizona
* The highest number of labs started during the period: 1960 - 69
* The number of facilities started during this period is : 152
* The agency that has the highest number of labs: NASA 2 (I guess it stands for NASA Glenn Research Facilities. I will confirm)
* During 2010- 2016 only two new lab facilities has been started. They are DYNAVAC THERMAL VACUUM CHAMBER and General Vibration Lab (GVL).
* Roslin HIcks handles the highest number of facilities. Under him there are 136 labs.
* Marshall Space Flight Center has the highest number of lab facilities. The number is again 136.
* There are 388 active NASA lab facilities in the US.
* There are 22 inactive lab facilities in the US.
