## Technical Communicators' Salary: Percent Growth 2005-2015 ##

This is my attempt to analyze the salary growth over the past decade in major Indian metros: Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai, and National Capital Region (Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad). It's to my surprise, Mumbai topped the list with close to 500% increase in annual growth, whereas in Bangalore it's only 100%.
