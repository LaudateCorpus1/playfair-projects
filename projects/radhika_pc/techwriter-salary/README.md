### Data Source ###

The raw data set has been provided by Society for Technical Communicators, India Chapter.


This is my attempt to analyze the salary growth over the past decade in major Indian metros: Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai, and National Capital Region (Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad). It's to my surprise, Mumbai topped the list with close to 500% increase in annual growth, whereas in Bangalore it's only 100%.
