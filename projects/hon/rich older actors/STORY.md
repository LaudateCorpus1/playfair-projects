title: Ages Above 40: The highest-earning actors versus the highest-earning actresses
summary: I studied Forbes' lists of [highest paid actors](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/) and [highest paid actresses](http://www.forbes.com/pictures/fimi45gfmkm/the-worlds-highest-paid/#5e9fb7931a2e), to see how many older artistes there are on each list. As it turns out, the top five highest paid men are all above the age of 40. (In fact, the top 13 male earners are above the age of 40.) Compare these results with the women's list. The highest earning woman above the age of 40 is Melissa McCarthy in third place, behind Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett Johansson. The combined income of the top five earning women above the age of 40 made a paltry $81.5m, compared with the men's $259.5m.  
The first chart shows how much these top earners make according to gender, age and income, while the second compares the box office earnings and results of the top five earning actors and actresses above the age of 40.
