# Hon's Super Secret Diary: Rich Actors

Six Questions I can ask my data:
1. How many older (above age 40) actors are there versus older actresses?
2. Is there a reason why men make more? Do their movies make more money?
3. Are there many more older men on the high-earners list compared to older women?


Notes:
* I managed to cobble some numbers together - manually - by using Forbes + Box Office Mojo data.
* I think from the charts you can see older actresses making a lot less aren't exactly doing poorly at the box office. But then I don't think it's also exactly fair to measure an actor's value based on how much his or her movies make at the box office. If I were doing a story I'd take a look at how an actor's value is calculated, perhaps by interviewing managers and industry insiders.

* Some weird formatting problems:
- I have weird lines everywhere after clipping board - release. What's going on.
- Jackie Chan doesn't display 2006
- Mapping all these charts one by one is very tedious
