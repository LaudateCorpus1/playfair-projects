Title: "It doesn't matter how terrible your movie is"
Summary: "Inspired by [fivethirtyeight‘s](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-three-types-of-adam-sandler-movies/) fascinating piece on Adam Sandler’s three types of movies, I decided to plot several charts using Box Office Mojo’s list of the top 100 highest-grossing movies of all time, and Rotten Tomatoes’ corresponding ratings for each movie. As it turns out, not every movie-goer is super concerned about quality."
