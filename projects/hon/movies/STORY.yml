summary: Inspired by [fivethirtyeight‘s](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-three-types-of-adam-sandler-movies/)
  fascinating piece on Adam Sandler’s three types of movies, I decided to plot several
  charts using Box Office Mojo’s list of the top 100 highest-grossing movies of all
  time, and Rotten Tomatoes’ corresponding ratings for each movie. As it turns out,
  not every movie-goer is super concerned about quality.
