# Hon's Super Secret Chart Diary 1

BoxOffice Mojo

Six Questions I can ask my data:
1. How many of the top fifty movies are part of a franchise? How many aren't part of a franchise?
2. How many movies in the top 50 are terrible? Can a movie that makes a lot of money be terrible?
3. What actors appear the most in these movies?
4. Why do terrible movies make money?
5. What are some of the common features of top 50 movies?
6. If a movie is in top 50 but has been ranked terribly on rotten tomatoes what could some of the reasons be?

Notes:
I want to make a chart about movies, because movies are fun.
I spent some time looking up Johnny Depp's box office records. Apparently he's the eighth highest grossing actor in terms of total box office. I tried to find data about how much he's paid per movie, but I couldn't find a credible source.
Then I thought about doing a stacked bar chart on the top grossing actors so you can see how some actors are on that chart because they've been in Hollywood for a really long time versus those who really draw audience. But that was too complicated.
Then I saw fivethirtyeight's chart on Adam Sandler's movies, how they rank on Rotten Tomatoes and how they do at the box office. So I decided to do a similar chart with the top fifty movies of all time.

Questions:
What kinds of charts can I create with matplotlib?
How to adjust for inflation
Is there a list of all the charts we can do in matplotlib
How to change all font size
How to change text in legend
