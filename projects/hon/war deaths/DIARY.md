# Hon's Super Secret Diary: War Deaths

Notes:
* This was meant to be a simpler project but I ended up taking quite a lot of time to complete it
* After an initial draft, I tried to make my chart more granular. That was okay but the data
was quite difficult to parse through, because a) I had to put every country into continents
manually and b) there isn't very good documentation (or at least I haven't found it) about
what document was for what cause of Deaths
* I also had to color the legend (which comes in the form of the map). That took at least an hour.
