This series explores the jail and prison inmate population in the U.S. from 1980 to 2014, with particular emphasis on change over time. A 1994 crime bill signed by then-President Bill Clinton is often blamed in part for the rise in prison/jail populations in the U.S. that have occurred in the last few decades. These graphics show that the rise in prison/jail population somewhat preceded this 1994 bill.
