Issues:

- The biggest issue with this project was in normalizing the data. I ended up changing many figures to per capita rates, but with more time, I would have liked to adjust for more factors (or at least compare to counties' median income, race breakdown, etc.). Also, some counties had more than one jail facility, which could be more clearly acknowledged in my finished graphics.
- The wide variance in how many people were are in each county made the rates somewhat misleading â€“ i.e. if a jail has only one person in it, and that one person is sentenced, it yields a 100% rate. I tried to label such anomalies, but with more time I would have found a better way to recognize or account for them.
