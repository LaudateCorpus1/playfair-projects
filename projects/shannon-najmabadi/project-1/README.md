I pulled data on the number of rapes in four of the five counties that make up New York City. The four initial charts were made in matplotlib, and then exported to Illustrator, where I changed text, gridlines, and most bars to shades of grey. The charts were horizontal in my first iteration, with year on the y-axis, but were revised to have year on the x-axis for clarity.
