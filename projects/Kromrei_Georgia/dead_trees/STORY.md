  title: "Street Trees of New York: "
  summary: "I was looking at the populations of dead trees in neighborhoods of New York, trying to figure out why there are so many more in East New York. It turns out that, while there are many more dead trees in East New York, this is mostly because there are more trees! After some data-wrangling, I've found the percentage of dead trees for each NTA, and I can compare that to the total tree population. In general, most neighborhoods have higher percentages of dead trees the less trees they have, and lower percentages the more trees they have.

  With more time, I would like to compare the percentages of dead trees in 2015 to the censuses that were taken in 2005 and 1995. I suspect there may be a difference in areas that were more severely impacted by Sandy.

  I had fun on this story experimenting with maps, learning how to make a new data frame by value counts, and figuring out how to work with a pretty large data frame. It was pretty frustrating."
