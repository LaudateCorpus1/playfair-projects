  title: "Dead Trees in New York Neighborhoods"
  summary: "Every 10 years, New York City does a census of all the street trees. 34 percent of the people that conduct the census are volunteers. Among several parameters the users record is whether or not the tree is dead, alive, or a stump-- but how is this distributed over neighborhoods? At first glance, it seems like there are some neighborhoods with many more dead trees than others, but the picture is more complicated than that. Neighborhoods with greater total number of trees are much more likely to have a higher number of dead trees (the correlation is .86), with few exceptions. This is best shown in the first figure.

  There are some outliers that have very high percentages of dead trees and a small population, most of them in Staten Island. If I had more time, I would love to find other parameters to merge this with-- perhaps median income, or upper respiratory illness. I'd also like to compare this data to the 1995 and 2005 data. I suspect there may be a difference in areas that were more severely impacted by Sandy in 2012. I'll work on it later!"
