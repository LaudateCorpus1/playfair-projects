I'll do a better job of keeping a diary next time: but for now, I'd like to say that I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out how to make a new data frame with value counts of a column that contained categorical (not continuous) data. I was stumped for a really long time, and I feel like my solution was pretty ham-handed, but it worked, and no one else I talked to had a more elegant solution for it.
