I'll do a better job of keeping a diary next time: but for now, I'd like to say that I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out how to make a new data frame with value counts of a column that contained categorical (not continuous) data. I was stumped for a really long time, and I feel like my solution was pretty ham-handed, but it worked, and no one else I talked to had a more elegant solution for it.


July 31: Okay, so I finally was able to export a CSV with the data I want, and merge it back in. Seems pretty horrible, but it is a working solution. This is horrible.

August 2: After talking about normalizing data (converting categorical to boolean or somesuch thing) in algorithms, I realize I really did go about this the long way. Better next time. Lambda functions are a game changer tbh.

August 2: Oh, best fit line. That should tell me something interesting.

August 2: I forgot all about the stumps! Stumps definitely count as dead trees. Redoing everything. All annotations are changed because counts are wildly different.
Made everything pretty.

  I had fun on this story experimenting with maps, learning how to make a new data frame by value counts, and figuring out how to work with a large and kind of unweildy data frame. It was pretty frustrating.
