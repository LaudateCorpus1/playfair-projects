This was not so challenging data-wise. I just copied and pasted from the webpage, then cleaned it up in the text editor.

Data was from: http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/541/541603842/541603842_200506_990.pdf
and: http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/climate-deniers/koch-pollution-on-campus/
