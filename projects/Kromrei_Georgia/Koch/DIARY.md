This was not so challenging data-wise. I just copied and pasted from the webpage, then cleaned it up in the text editor.

It was fun getting the hang of layers and color palettes. It really, really dramatically improves the workflow and allows me to spend less time staring at small things on a screen, and more time thinking about what I want to do with the numbers, so that's great!

I found it challenging to work with tax returns. I was initially really excited, and I still think there is a LOT of information to be gleaned there, but I decided against using it because I feel I would have needed to study them intensively, and probably with the consultation of an accountant or other expert. Each document was pretty complicated, though there were some interesting tidbits I could see pretty easily. It was difficult to translate that into a spreadsheet with anything resembling continuous values for graphing.
