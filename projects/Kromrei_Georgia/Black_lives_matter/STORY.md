  title: "Black Preschoolers are Punished Disproportionately"
  summary: "Racial bias is recognized in our criminal justice system and in our school system, but it is shocking to see how evident it is in preschool. Black preschoolers are given suspensions and expulsions more than their white classmates. Female black preschoolers are even _more_ likely to receive disciplinary actions. Schools that punish their children more tend to have higher black enrollment."
