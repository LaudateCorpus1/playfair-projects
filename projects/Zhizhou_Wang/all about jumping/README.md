* How did the Olympics record change among the years for these four jumping competition (long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault), what are some factors that contributed to the broken of records, etc.
* I cleaned up the data with Ipython Notebook, make a defult style line chart with matplotlib and export it to AI to make further polishments. Then I created the web page to fit in the large amont of text.
