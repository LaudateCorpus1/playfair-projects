* On 15 July 2016, a coup d'Ã©tat was attempted in Turkey against the government. After that, coup has been a popular topic among the public as well as media. But what's the definition of coup? How do we define a successful coup?  With the data from Global instances of coups from 1950 to 2010: A new dataset, the graphic below presents all coups from 1950 to 2010.
* I cleaned up the data with Ipython Notebook, make a defult style line chart with matplotlib and export it to AI to make further polishments.
* You can find everything in my repository: https://github.com/jowang0319/suc_coup/tree/gh-pages.
