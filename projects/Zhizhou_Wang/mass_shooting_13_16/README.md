* This is a project about mass shooting around the United States. (Maybe a part of a larger project, will add a link to the whole project once complited.)
* I cleaned up the data with Ipython Notebook, make a defult style line chart with matplotlib and export it to AI to make further polishments.
* You can find the notebook, data, and the draft pdf.
