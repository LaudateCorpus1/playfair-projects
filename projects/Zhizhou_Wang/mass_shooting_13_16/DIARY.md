## Diary

* I had a big plan about the data when I first saw it as the mass shooting and gun control problem is quite a big problem in US right now. I draw a long graphic draft, but due to the deadline thing, I had to break them up into small pieces.
* Another thing I wanted to do is to use Twitter API to track the "GunControl" tag, to see whethere the frequency of people talking about this topic is related to the real life media publication. But the Twitter API thing was kinda complicated so I decided to save this for later.
