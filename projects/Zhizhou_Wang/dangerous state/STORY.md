title: "The Most Dangerous State"
summary: Mass shooting casualties certainly have a positive relationship with population. However, while calculating the casualty rate by population, District of Columbia, Luisiana and Illinois are the top three of the most dangerous states.  Comparing the top three mass shooting rate state with the bottom ones, D.C. evidently has the most strict regulation on guns while the rate is still the highest. Does state gun law really infect the mass shooting rate?
