## Unpaid overtime in Spain

The [Economically Active Population Survey] (http://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Tabla.htm?t=4364&L=1) carried out by Spain's National Statistics Institute gathers a lot of information about the labour market. One of the questions asked aims at finding out how many hours each worker does as overtime, both paid and unpaid. This information is broken down by gender and occupation. My goal was to visualize the evolution of the unpaid overtime in the last years.

Since the data were already clean, I did not need to work too much on that - apart from doing some calculations to find the average values. Using `matplotlib` to plot the data in Python, I polished my graphs with Adobe Illustrator.
