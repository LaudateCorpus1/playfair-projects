### Accessibility of Paris' subway network

This story builds on my previous one about the accessibility of Madrid's subway network. In this case, I wanted to compare the Madrid with Paris, based on the open data that the RATP publishes on [their website](http://data.ratp.fr/explore/dataset/accessibilite-des-gares-et-stations-metro-et-rer-ratp/).

While working on this data, I also received information from the MTA about the accessible stations in NYC subway. So I have added this data to create a graph comparing the three cities' networks. The main headline is that Madrid does way much better than Paris and NYC, mainly because the Spain's capital network is newer.
