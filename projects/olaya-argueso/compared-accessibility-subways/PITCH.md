## Accessibility of Paris' subway network

After analyzing how wheelchair-friendly NYC's and Madrid's undergrounds are, I want to add Paris to the equation. I have already downloaded the data (as a .csv) from [RATP's website](http://data.ratp.fr/explore/dataset/accessibilite-des-gares-et-stations-metro-et-rer-ratp/), and I have obtained from them the documentation to correctly interpret the codes they use.

As in my previous project about Madrid (Pitch #), I would like to create a map in which the non-accessible stations are removed. This could be complemented with other kind of graph (bar charts?).
