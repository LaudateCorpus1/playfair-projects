# Are female athletes honoring the public funding they receive?

My goal with this project was to find out if my hunch about the exploit of female state-backed athletes was correct. Spain, as many other countries, sponsors its best athletes, so that they can focus in improving their performance. In recent years, there seemed to have been an outstanding rise in the number of medals that sportswomen were bringing back home. I decided to get the data and check whether I was right.

First, I needed to scrape the data from [this page](http://www.ado.es/becados/listado/), which proved not to be such an easy task as I have thought. After a lot of work (and help), I finally got a list of all the athletes, together with their gender - which I had to add manually -, their results in international competitions and the number of years they had been benefitting from the public funding. [One caveat about the data: they only include athletes for individual sports, i.e., soccer, basketball, etc., are not included here.]

When I got down to the analysis, the data revealed that I was right: women have won two in three medals since 2003 in all kind of international competitions (Olympic Games, and World and European Championships). Besides, most of the outliers - athletes that have won an outstanding amount of medals when compared to the number of years they have been sponsored - are also women.

Therefore, the answer to the question in the title of this project is definitely YES!
