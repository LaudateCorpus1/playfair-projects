### How accessible are Madrid's subway stations?

The aim of this project is to find out how easy or difficult is to make one's way through Madrid's subway network when having mobility problems (wheelchair users, elderly people) or other needs (parents with babies on strollers, travelers carrying their luggage). My inspiration comes from [this map](https://subwayrecord.wordpress.com/2015/03/26/the-mtas-accessibility-gap/) of NYC's subway network, which shows only the accessible stations. 

The database has been built manually from Metro de Madrid's website (more details about the sources of this project and links to them can be found in the DIARY.md file).
