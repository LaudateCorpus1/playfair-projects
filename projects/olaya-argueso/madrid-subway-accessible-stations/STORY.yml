title: How accessible is Madrid's subway network?
summary: Two thirds of the stations are adapted for people with disabilities. However,
  12% are still only accessible through stairs. Most of those stations are located
  in the central area of Madrid, and they belong to the oldest lines. There are construction
  works planned (summer 2016), but they do not include revamping the stations.
