    During a year (from April, 2008 to April, 2009), José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero led a gender balanced cabinet, half of its members being women. His two terms (2004-2008, 2008-2011) were the only period in Spain's recent history were at least 40% of the Ministers were women.

### Design

- I chose a line chart to visualize the trend in a easier way, but I encountered the problem of the years where the x axis values was 0. Since I did not want to get rid of the bottom line, it creates a weird effect.

- I would also have liked to show the minor ticks, but was not able to solve that issue.

- As of the labels for the years, the default option in Python was this oblique display and could not turn it into a horizontal one. 

- The text boxes provide context to a reader who may not be familiar with Spanish recent political history.
