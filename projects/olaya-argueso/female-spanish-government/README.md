##Female Ministers' presence in Spain's Government

This database - built by myself manually, with a little help of import.io - gathers information about how many women have been a member of the Spanish Government since 1977, when democracy returned to the country - after a 40-year long dictatorship. The source is [La Moncloa's website](http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/gobierno/gobiernosporlegislaturas/Paginas/index.aspx) and this piece of data belongs to a wider project I led in 2015: [Mapa del poder femenino / Map of women's power](mapapoderfemenino.com/en).

After creating a database with every single member of every cabinet since 1977 until the end of 2015, and their gender, I just calculated the female proportion in each cabinet. I did all that in Excel. I then exported it to Pandas, in order to carry out the plotting, using `matplotlib`, and polished it with Adobe Illustrator.
