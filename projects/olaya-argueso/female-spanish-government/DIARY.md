I had already worked on the analysis of this database, so I did not carry out any now. I just read the Excel file in Pandas to be able to plot it.

I did a plain line graph that I enriched with some annotation to make sure a reader who is not familiar with Spain's recent history can understand it.

After receiving feedback, I changed the scale on the sides, modified the title and replaced the line for an area graph to make it more explicit. I also added a curved line on the 2004-2011 period to make the annotation above it clearer.

I also got rid of the numbers on the left, made the title bigger (and as a consequence of the title needing more space, I got rid of the 100 at the top of the y-axis) and shadowed in pale grey the terms where her has been more female ministers. I therefore deleted the curved line that worked as an "umbrella" to indicate Zapatero's era. Removing the even numbers from the y-axis label cleans the graph without omitting relevant information.

Enlarged the whole graph area, so that I could include annotations out of the chart itself. I left the bigger explanatory texts below the chart and reduced the annotations within the chart to a headline. I also aligned the lines outside and inside the chart area.
