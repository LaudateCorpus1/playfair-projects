I had already worked on the analysis of this database, so I did not carry out any now. I just read the Excel file in Pandas to be able to plot it.

I did a plain line graph that I enriched with some annotation to make sure a reader who is not familiar with Spain's recent history can understand it.

After receiving feedback, I changed the scale on the sides, modified the title and replaced the line for an area graph to make it more explicit. I also added a curved line on the 2004-2011 period to make the annotation above it clearer.
