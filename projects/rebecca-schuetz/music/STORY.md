title: The Rise and Fall of Genres
summary: Throughout the decades, Billboard has been keeping score on the hits. So what types of music tend to take over the airwaves? It depends on the year. This chart uses genre data from Last.FM, Spotify, and Billboard to visualize which genres have fared the best over the past half century.

Here's how many of the top 20 spots these genres showed up every year on average:

Note: If a song could be considered part of two genres, such as Maroon 5's "Harder to Breathe" (pop and rock), it shows up here as both.

And just as some songs are crossovers between genres, some songs fall into more than on subgenre. Take Drake for example: Pop rap? Indie r&b? Spotify argues he's both, and so he appears in both graphs here.

However, in the graph above, even though "Hotline Bling" may be two flavors of r&b/hip hop, it's only counted once for the overall category.
