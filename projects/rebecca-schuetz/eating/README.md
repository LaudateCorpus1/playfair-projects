Those Who Sweat Together, Eat Together
======
This chart uses the Harmonized European Time Survey to graph what percentage of the population is eating throughout the day for each country represented in the data. Then the graphs were ordered by their average high temperatures based on information from Weatherbase, and each one was filled the same color to varying opacities based on that temperature.
