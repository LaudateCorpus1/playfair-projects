#"Voter Turnout: U.S voter turnout notoriously low compared to other developed and emerging economies"

##Data

I used data from three different sources.
The data I used for my first chart is from Pew Research. This data has the voter turnout for the last elections in every member country the OECD. It gives the percentage of the voting age population that cast a vote as well as the percentage of the registered population that cast a vote. (http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/02/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/)
For the second chart, I used data from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) and integrated it with the first dataset. This data contained information about which countries have laws that make voting compulsory. (http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm)
For the third chart I also used my first dataset, and this time added data for how the voting registration is done for each country in the OCED. I got this data from The Electoral Knowledge Network (ACE). For this last chart, I also had to do research for each country and its registration systems since the data was not complete.

##Code

My code is in an ipython notebook. I used matplotlib for the charts. See documentation (project3_voter_turnout.ipynb)
