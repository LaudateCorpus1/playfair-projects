#Caracas, the world's most murderous city
# Story summary: Eight Venezuelan cities made it to the list of the 50 most dangerous cities in the world in 2015.
 Caracas, Venezuela's capital, topped the list with 3,946 homicides last year.


### Possible questions to ask the data:
Mi original idea was to divide this project into two parts.
Part one would be comparing the 50 top dangerous cities based on rate of murders and total number of murders.
Part two would be comparing the Venezuelan government official numbers with those of two non-profits.
Since completing chart one took me longer than I expected I decided to drop part 2 of the project.



### Making the chart
I used a chart from Economist.com  as inspiration. At first, I was not sure what type of chart it was.
Nicky helped me and introduced me to strip charts!
Making one was easier than I expected.
I used the melt function to group my data into countries and obtain the murder rate for each city in each of these countries.
I later imported seaborn and used the stripplot function to plot my chart.
I took my chart to Illustrator to add another layer of information.
I now wanted to add the total number of homicides per city (not the rate).
To do that I watched one of Soma's videos on how to use Illustrator's pie tool to make sized-circle bubble charts.


### Design decisions

Once I had added the additional layer of information on Illustrator, I decided to change the bubble's colors according to 
the number of murders. Later, I got rid of the color classification (as suggested by many).
I labeled some of the cities, so it would give the viewer an idea of what the most dangerous cities in the world are.
I am still not sure if not labeling some of the cities was a good decision. However, if I labelled them all, the chart was going
to end up too messy.
