#Caracas, the world's most murderous city
 
#Production details for this project


##Summary
Eight Venezuelan cities made it to the list of the 50 most dangerous cities in the world in 2015.
Caracas, Venezuela's capital, topped the list with 3,946 homicides last year.
In this project I explore how the world's most dangerous cities compare to each other in rate and number of homicides for 2015.

##Data

###Chart 1
I obtain data from a non-governmental organization called Mexican Citizen Council for public security and criminal justice (project_5_PythonExport.csv).
I combined two of their datasets because the first one did not have data on total number of murders, but just the rate of homicide.

##Code

My code is in an ipython notebook.
I used seaborn stripplot for the charts.
And illustrator for adding another layer of information to the chart and the final touches. See documentation (project_5_violent_cities.ipynb).
