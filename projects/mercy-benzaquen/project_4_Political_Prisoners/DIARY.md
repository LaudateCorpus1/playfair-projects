#Political prisoners in Venezuela
# Story summary: In this two-chart story I explore the topic of justice in Venezuela, getting into a timeline of political arrests and the perceptions of Venezuelans on their judicial system.

#CHART 1
I requested data from Foro Penal, a Venezuelan non-profit that have kept record of all the political imprisonments since 2002.
I did not hear back from them so I scraped their website.
I obtained information on 86 political prisoners, their names, date of arrest, profession, and detention facility.
I also made additional research to annotate the chart.


##DATA SET 1

### Possible questions to ask the data:

-How many political prisoners are in Venezuela (names, date of detention, are they students, politicians, if so, what party they support?)
-What charges where they arrested on?
-What was happening in the country when they were arrested?
-How long is their prison sentence?



### Problems I encountered
- Before starting to work on this project I knew I wanted to use data from the Venezuelan non-profit Foro Penal.
They have been collecting data on political arrests since 2002. I found additional data sets about political prisoners in Venezuela
but I knew they had more information that I could work with (for example, details on the prisoners, their arrests and sentences).
I did not hear back from them so I scraped the website. Everything was going great until I realized that I had all the data with the dates in Spanish.
Pandas did not let me parse the dates, so I had to export my data as a csv and manually translate the dates (luckily the data set was not really big so it took me 10 minutes).


### Design decisions

- The thing I liked the most about chart 1 was how striking it was to see the rise of arrests starting after 2013. 
I had the idea of annotating the chart to give background information of what was going on in the country at the time of the arrests.
When I added my annotations, I felt the chart lost a bit of its charm. I tried looking for other alternatives to annotate the information
but all of them ended up filling the white space that made the chart so interesting and easy to read at first. I decided to use different
font sizes and bolding to make it easier for the reader to navigate the chart since it is a mix of bar chart and timeline.
- I want with a bright red for the bars because is the color of the government party and I felt it make sense to relate the political prisoners with them.
- I decided to add the pictures to make the chart more relatable. I was giving my readers TONS of information and I thought I needed to give them a face they could recognize and relate to.



#CHART 2
I used data from the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index (2015) study. The data compiles scores for 44 indicators in 8 categories in 102 countries. The study surveyed locals at each country on their perceptions of justice in their countries.

##DATA SET 2

### Possible questions to ask the data:
- What are the perceptions Venezuelans have on the country justice system
- In which category Venezuela does best? worst?
- How is Venezuela compared to other countries?
- Is this the first study of this kind, do we have historical data?


### Problems I encountered
- The data was fairly easy to work with. 
- It took me a loooong time to make the final edits in illustrator since it took maybe 2-3 minutes to load every time I made an edit.
- I was not sure how to make this chart match the previous one. I was trying to add information to create a link between them.
My first chart was talking about Maduro making more political arrests than Chavez, and my second one was talking about Venezuelans not trusting their justice system.
This made sense to me. But I spent hours looking at both datasets and finding links between them. I decided to dig deeper into the criminal justice category of the Rule of Law Index.
This category would make a stronger link with the political imprisonments. I added a small chart with info of how Venezuela did in this category. Not surprisingly, Venezuela ranked last, and
even obtained a zero (lowest possible score) for the category of government involvement in criminal justice.
 
### Design decisions
-I used oranges and red to continue with the colors used in the first chart
-I originally was going to do 3 charts but decided to group charts #2 and #3 together.
