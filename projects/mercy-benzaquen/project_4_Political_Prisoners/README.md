#Political prisoners in Venezuela 


#Production details for this project


##Summary
In this two-chart story I explore the topic of justice in Venezuela, getting into a timeline of political arrests and the perceptions of Venezuelans on their judicial system.

##Data

###Chart 1
I requested data from Foro Penal, a Venezuelan non-profit that have kept record of all the political imprisonments since 2002. I did not hear back from them so I scraped their website. I obtained information on 86 political prisoners, their names, date of arrest, profession, and detention facility (project_4_chart_1_PythonExport.csv).
I also made additional research to annotate the chart.

### Chart 2
I used data from the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index (2015) study. The data compiles scores for 44 indicators in 8 categories in 102 countries. The study surveyed locals at each country on their perceptions of justice in their countries. See documentation (project_1_WJP_chart_2_data.xlsx).

##Code

My code is in an ipython notebook. I used matplotlib for the charts. Carto and Qgis for the maps. And illustrator for all the final touches. See documentation (project_4_political_prisoners.ipynb.ipynb).
