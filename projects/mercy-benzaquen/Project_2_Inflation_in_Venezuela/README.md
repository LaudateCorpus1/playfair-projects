#Production details for this project
#Inflation in Venezuela

##Data

For my first chart I manually created a dataset using information from the www.cendasfvm.org. I have uploaded it with the rest of the documentation (database_chart_1.xlsx).
For my second chart I used a dataset that CENDA sent me. See documentation (database_chart_2.xlsx).

##Code

My code is in an ipython notebook. I used matplotlib for the charts. See documentation (Venezuela_minimum_wage_vs_food_prices.ipynb).
