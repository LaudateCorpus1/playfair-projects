  title: "Inflation in Venezuela: The minimum wage is not enough to feed a family in Venezuela"
  summary: "I looked at data from the Venezuelan non-profit CENDA. I worked with data for the minimum wage and the cost of the basic food basket for the months of January to June of this year (2016). I also worked with a dataset of the breakdown of the food in the basic food basket and its prices for years 2015 and 2016."

For the first chart I compared the minimum wage with the cost of the basic food basket. Both increased in the 6-months timeframe but the cost of the basic food basket increases at a much higher rate and magnitude.

For the second chart, I go into details. I plot the prices for some products of the basic basket and compare their prices for the year 2015 and for this year. The difference is shocking.
