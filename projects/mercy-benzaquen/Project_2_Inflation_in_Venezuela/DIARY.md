#INFLATION IN VENEZUELA
# Story: The minimum wage is not enough to feed a family in Venezuela

It was hard to obtain the data for this story since the government of Venezuela doesn't have an available public dataset of the information I needed.
CENDA, a Venezuelan non-profit that gathers data about workers' life conditions provided me with the necessary information for this story.
For my first chart I used information of the minimum wage and the cost of the basic food basket for the months of Jan to June of 2016. I obtained this information from the CENDA's website (www.cendasfvm.org) and manually created a dataset.
For my second chart I used a dataset with the prices of products of the basic food basket in the year 2015 and 2016.

### Possible questions to ask the data:

  - How has the price of food increased compared to the minimum wage?
  - What can a person buy with a 1-month salary?
  - How many people can live from one salary?
  - How has the food of a specific product, let's say, an apple, have changed in the past year?
  - What is the most expensive product of the basic food basket?


### Problems I encountered

  - I had a problem in mind as soon as I came up for the idea for this story. The inflation in Venezuela and the rapid change of prices is hard to understand even for a Venezuelan. I was not sure what currency I would use to make it clearer for non-venezuelans to understand the change in food prices and the increase in the minimum wage. An additional challenge was that the Venezuelan currency, the Bolivar, has two exchange rates. The first one is the one set by the government and the second one is that of the black market. The main problem Venezuelans are facing is that food is so scarce that they are willing to pay the prices of the black market in order to get it. The government has set "fair prices" for the basic food products. But people can only get the food at those prices at the government-run supermarkets, which usually have huge lines and run out of food because of the high demand. People have to wait for hours to buy groceries in those supermarkets, hours that they could have spent working and making money. And sometimes when they get to the front of the line there is no more food for them.

  So I decided to show the reality by using the prices of the black market, the prices that Venezuelans really have to pay for food.
  Instead of converting the prices from the Venezuelan currency to dollars, I decided to compare apples with apples. Since the exchange rate of the black market is continuously changing, I decided to use all my data in Bolivares. Some of my peers thought this would be confusing but changed their minds when I explained  that it would be easier to see the price of food in Bolivares compared to the minimum wage in Bolivares.

  - I created the first data set and it took me sometime to put all the information together since I was getting it from different parts of the CENDA's website. The dataset I used for the second chart was clean and manageable.

  - Venezuelans also receive a food bonus, that is extra money with the minimum wage. I had to find what the extra bonus was for each month and added up with the minimum wage.

  - I was not happy with the first results, I felt the story had so much potential and that I needed to include so many details and explanations that the charts were going to look too messy. I decided to get rid of the legend for the first graph and made it part of the title so I would gain a bit more of white space. I also used a very light font so the text would not take over the chart.

  - I was not sure if I should order the info in the second chart by % of price increase or by most expensive products. To make it more visually appealing I ordered the food products by price (since that was in my x axis), and used annotation to add the % of price increase.

### Design decisions

  - I struggled a little bit with my first chart because when I plotted minimum wage and the cost of the food basket in the same graph, the scale was so big (because of the food basket prices) that it was very hard to see what the minimum wage was. I decided to use annotation to make it clearer.
  - I used the color orange for no specific reason but I really liked the results.
  - It took me some time to be able to fill in the space between the lines in my first chart. I tried to do it using matplotlib but then switched to illustrator.
  - For the second chart I kept very light grids to help orient the eye since it is a very big chart.
  - I got rid of charts and ticks for the first graph since it included a lot of annotation and I wanted to balance it out.
  - I had to use different font sizes to organize the info in my charts. This was tricky since it looked messy at some points.
  - My second chart was too long so I had to split it in two and add a copy of the x axis in the middle so the reader would not get lost when scrolling down.
