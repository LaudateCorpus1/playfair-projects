##Data

###Chart 1
I obtained data from 2 different sources.
Data for the first chart and map was from The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
I obtained the data for my third and fourth visualization from Pew Research Center and it was from the U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services data.


##Code

My code is in an ipython notebook.
I used matplotlib for the charts.
I used Carto and QGIS for the map.
And illustrator for adding the final touches.
