#Venezuelan asylees, a growing population
# Story summary: This project explores the increase in asylum requests by Venezuelans to other countries since 1999.
It also focuses on requests to the U.S since 2014, when Venezuela entered the list of top 10 asylum-seekers nationalities to the U.S.


### Possible questions to ask the data:
How many Venezuelans apply for asylum?
Which is the country with the most requests from Venezuelans?
What has been the year with the most requests?



### Making the chart
I used three charts and one map to cover different angles of my topic.
The first visualization is a chart shows the asylum requests filed by Venezuelans from 1999 to 2016. It has some annotations explaining the increase of request in certain years.
The second visualization is a map showing all the countries that received requests from Venezuelans for the year 2016. Intensity in color shows bigger number of asylum applications.
The third visualization is a line chart showing the top 10 asylum-seeking nations to the U.S from 2014 to 2016.
The fourth and last visualization in an horizontal bar chart showing the top 4 asylum-seeking countries to the U.S from Jan to June 2016.

### Design decisions

Design wise I used a lot of what I have been using in my past projects. Initially I had chosen blue for my color scheme but changed it to burgundy and reds, which are
usually used to represent Venezuela.
