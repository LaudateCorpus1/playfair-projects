  title: "Voter Turnout: U.S voter turnout notoriously low compared to other developed and emerging economies"
  summary: "I used data from ACE, IDEA, and Pew Research to paint a picture of how U.S voter turnout looks when compared to other countries. I divided the story in 3, creating a chart for each part. The first part gives an introductory look and compares U.S voter turnout with that of other 34 countries (OECD members). The second one compares U.S voter turnout with that of the 4 countries in the OECD group that have compulsory voting laws. And the third chart compares how the countries with universal registration among the group of 34 do compared to others with individual registration like the U.S"
