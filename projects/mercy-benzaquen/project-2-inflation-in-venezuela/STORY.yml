title: 'Inflation in Venezuela: The minimum wage is not enough to feed a family in
  Venezuela'
summary: I looked at data from the Venezuelan non-profit CENDA. I worked with data
  for the minimum wage and the cost of the basic food basket for the months of January
  to June of this year (2016). I also worked with a dataset of the breakdown of the
  food in the basic food basket and its prices for years 2015 and 2016.
