Training but also experience is essential to marathon runners. The winner of the last “Course de l’Escalade” – a marathon in Geneva – was 33 years old (He's born in August 12, 1982).

This race takes place in the center of the city. Old cobblestones and narrow streets make the path difficult for the competitors.

Amongst women runners, the winner was 21 years old. But close behind her, #2 and #3 were both 28 years old. And the oldest female runner, aged 60, got a 76th rank out of 196 rivals.

In the “Course de l’Escalade”’s data, there is no clear correlation between age and result. The “r” coefficient is only -0.55.
