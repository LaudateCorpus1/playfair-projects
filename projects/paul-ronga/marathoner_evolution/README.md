# The raise and decay of long-distance runner strength

How long do marathoners get better over time? Is there an inflexion at a specific age?

I never found an appropriate answer to this question. The purpose of collecting and analyzing ten years of the Geneva Marathon's data was to give an answer.

With my dataset, r = 0.398 only.

## Data set

All 12 csv files are in the [project folder](https://github.com/palrogg/playfair-projects/tree/master/projects/paul-ronga/marathoner_evolution).
