# The raise and decay of long-distance runner strength

How long do marathoners get better over time? Is there an inflexion at a specific age?

I spent a lost of time trying to find an answer to this question using correlation. Unfortunately, r is only 0.398 between date of birth and year of performance drop.

But actually, the mode is 39-40 years old... Of course, there was no need for correlation, but for a histogram!

## Data set

All 12 csv files are in the [project folder](https://github.com/palrogg/playfair-projects/tree/master/projects/paul-ronga/marathoner_evolution).
