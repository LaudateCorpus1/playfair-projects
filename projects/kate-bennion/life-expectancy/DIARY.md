## Country Data
1. which country had the biggest increase over the past 50 years?
2. what are the most dynamic life expectancy changes/events?
3. which countries are trending downward?
4. continent-related? linked to other countries geographically or event-wise?
5. how much of the population has how much global GDP?
6. GDP and life expectancy related?
## Issues
Wanted to group color scheme by continent and have each line be a different color
Eventually created a dataframe from each continent and then grouped in
Line thickness by population?? Gave up on that one, too confusing

There was so MUCH data that annotating it or choosing what was interesting/important to highlight/annotate was difficult... honestly it might be better as an interactive overall. I ended up choosing some dramatic data points that I thought were interesting to annotate.

I debated labeling them with events (such as HIV crisis in sub-saharan Africa, Rwandan genocide, etc) but didn't want to infer causality too much? So I ended up going with just naming labels.

I ran into some issues when trying to isolate one line (i.e. country) to highlight (via either thickness or opacity?). I ended up just manually using the pen tool in Illustrator, ugh. Would not recommend.
