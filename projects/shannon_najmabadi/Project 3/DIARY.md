Issues:

- I really struggled with the colors, as I wanted a cohesive palette, but didn't want there to be confusion about similar colors representing the same thing -- especially as it already is somewhat difficult to delineate the difference between state/federal prison or prison/jail to a reader not knowledgeable about the U.S. penal system.
- I also struggled with the fact that there were a bevy of tough on crime policies and similar socioeconomic conditions that contributed to a rising prison/jail population. I only looked at one bill in these graphics; perhaps I will look at more in future projects.
- With more time, I also would have normalized all the data for increases in population that have occurred during these decades.
