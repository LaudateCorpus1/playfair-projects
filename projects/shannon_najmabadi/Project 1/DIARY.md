Issues:

- How to portray the jail chart. Thought a line chart would be best but too cluttered?
- Hard to get the dots unclipped in order to change color once matplotlib is exported to Illustrator.
- Is there a way to label all the data to to make annotating in Illustrator easier?

Design Decisions:

Image 1:

- Tried to make vertical charts instead (with year on the x-axis), but went with horizontal charts for aesthetic reasons. [Switched back to vertical based on feedback]
- All text, gridlines and most bars in shades of grey. The bar I'd like to call attention to is in maroon. [Switched to a darker/heavier shade of grey based on feedback]

Image 2:

- Again, all text, points, grid lines in shades of grey or black. [Made grey darker, per feedback]
- Data points I'd like to call attention to in maroon.
- Wanted to connect the lines (line chart) to make the trend for every jail more clear, but thought it would look too cluttered. [Made it a line chart and, indeed, clearer]
- Might be better using D3 so you could rollover each line for more info.
