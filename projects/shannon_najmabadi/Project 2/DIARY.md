Issues:

- Initially, I made all the graphics with the 2008-2014 range of data. I thought it better to redo two of them to reflect a single year's worth of data, rather than the six year range.
- I had difficulty figuring out how best to overlay the graphic showing age of female inmates on top of the similar graphic showing male and female ages (in terms of design)
- With more time, I would have added a similar chart for the last graphic, showing the per capita comparison of how many inmates each county has relative to its total population.
