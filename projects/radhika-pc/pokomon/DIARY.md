## Challenges I Faced While Working on the Story ##

* Year information wasn't displaying correctly on the X-axis
* formatter = mdates.DateFormatter('%Y/%M/%d') giving incorrect values
* Color combination for the graphics
* Playing with various options in Illustrator
* Developing  an interesting story around the data. (Thanks to my peer reviewers and editor for the help)
* Design decisions: I wanted to display all the trends in some way, so I chose to go for small multiples, but I used Illustrator.
* There is no reason for choosing particular Color scheme
