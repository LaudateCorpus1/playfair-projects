# Production details for this project

## Data

Data is from the 2012 [American Community Survey](American Community Survey), Table B12002, [Sex By Marital Status By Age For The Population 15 Years And Over](http://www.socialexplorer.com/pub/ReportData/metabrowser.aspx?survey=ACS2012&ds=American+Community+Survey+2012&table=B12002&header=True). They're 3-year estimates because I figured, hey, sounds like a good balance between the 1-year and 5-year estimates.

Cities are based on [Metropolitan Statistical Areas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area), which are much wider than the actual cities themselves.

## Code

The map is in theory made from D3, but this is just a screenshot since it is, of course, just an example `README.md` file.
