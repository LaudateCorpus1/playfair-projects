# Playfair Projects ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsoma/playfair-projects.svg?branch=master)

This is where we'll be organizing our pitching/writing/etc process for all of the [Lede Program's](http://ledeprogram.com) Playfair projects.
  
## Introduction

Playfair is a way for both current and previous students to stay on top of analysis, visualization, and all the arcane corners of data. Our goals are:

* **Create quality portfolio pieces** through a process that involves feedback and editorial oversight.
* **Give and receive feedback** to make our projects collectively better, along with making sure we're functional members of society.
* **Create documentation of our processes** so that others can learn from what we've created (and the really intense can reproduce and check our work)

Sounds good?

## The Pitching/Submitting Process

> See an example user directory with a project inside in the [examples folder](/jsoma/playfair-projects/tree/master/examples/)
