# Pitch issue checklist

After you create a pitch issue, **cut and paste the following at the bottom of your pitch issue**. Do **not** paste it as the first comment, I was wrong!

After the comment has been submitted, you'll be able to use the checkboxes interactively. When all the boxes are checked, you'll be able to create a story issue.

Find more details on [PITCHING.md](PITCHING.md).
